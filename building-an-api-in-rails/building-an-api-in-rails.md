### Getting Started

To demonstrate how to create a Rails API to send JSON responses, we will modify the code from the lesson [Nested-Routes-Going-Camping][nested-routes-going-camping]. If you haven't already done so, `et get` this lesson, and you will see starter code from this assignment that you can walk through with.

et get building-an-api-in-rails
cd building-an-api-in-rails

### Introduction

APIs are a common feature of today's web applications. [Google](https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/), [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/dev/api), [Twitter](https://dev.twitter.com/overview/documentation), and [Github](https://developer.github.com/v3/) all have APIs within their software that can be accessed to transfer information to and from external clients. Rails gives you the necessary classes to create your own API. This lesson will go through the basic structure of a client-side API that delivers a universal response known as JSON.

### JavaScript Object Notation

> JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format. It is easy for humans to read and write. It is easy for machines to parse and generate.

[Source](http://www.json.org/)

Since most every programming language has a means of representing name/value pairs and ordered collections, JSON is an optimal format for exchanging information between clients and servers, and between servers. This can be especially useful when interacting between applications written in different languages (say Ruby and JavaScript!). You should remember working with JSON along with React — we'll be building on that experience. Pay attention to what you want your data structure to look like and how to interact with it to make creating APIs as pain-free as possible.

### Creating a JSON Endpoint with Rails

The first step is to create a new route for our API endpoint. This will allow us to have both a controller that will send back regular HTML (as we created in earlier lessons) and controllers that send back JSON in response to API calls. For demonstration, we will use the Campers model. We will modify our `routes.rb` file by adding the following code:

```ruby
# config/routes.rb

Rails.application.routes.draw do
...
  namespace :api do
    namespace :v1 do
      resources :campers, only: [:index]
    end
  end
...
end
```

This will create an API path to access our campers information in the JSON format. We add `api` after the `namespace` keyword to let people know that this controller will be returning JSON. This is called "namespacing"(read more about namespacing [here][namespace docs]).

We also add the `v1` namespace in order to create a form of version control for the APIs we create. `v1` stands for "version 1". By including `v1`, we proactively account for the possibility that we may eventually have updated versions of our APIs. Let's say we wanted to completely overhaul our API, but any changes would immediately break our app. We would be able to continue to use our first version until the second was finished and we were ready to transition.

In the routes, these namespaces simply add the additional slashes to the URL that you will see if you run `bundle exec rake routes`. Namespaces also make it possible for us to separate out our regular controllers from our API controllers, otherwise we would have two controllers and models with the exact same `CampersController` name. When we run `bundle exec rake routes`, you will see the new route appear:

```no-highlight
$ bundle exec rake routes
api_v1_campers  GET /api/v1/campers(.:format)  api/v1/campers#index
```

From here, we need to set up our API controller. In our `app/controllers` folder, we need to create an `api` folder, and then within this folder create a `v1` folder. This is so that Rails will know where to find our namespaced controller based on its conventions. Here, we will create another `CampersController`, this time under the API namespace, that will be responsible for returning the JSON representation of `Campers`, instead of the HTML representation of them. Namespacing things under the API::V1 namespace in our controller class definition allows us to have these multiple `CampersController`s that return different things. It should be noted that adding this API controller will not interfere with the functionality of your current controller because of this namespacing.

Within this controller, we can then add an index method that will return all of our campers back in a JSON format. As you can see, we get all of our campers from the database using a simple `Camper.all` call. Once we have these Camper objects, we can then render them all back as JSON in the response. `render json:` is the Rails way of saying you want to return a collection of data back in the response as a JSON (you may remember seeing a similar thing in our Sinatra APIs).

```ruby
# app/controllers/api/v1/campers_controller.rb
class Api::V1::CampersController < ApplicationController
  def index
    render json: Camper.all
  end
end
```

Now, if we start our server and visit <http://localhost:3000/api/v1/campers> we will get the following JSON output (with the exception of the created_at and updated_at which will be specific to when you ran `bundle exec rake db:seed`:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Rovaira",
    "campsite_id": 1,
    "created_at": "2015-12-15T21:22:55.617Z",
    "updated_at": "2015-12-15T21:22:55.617Z"
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "name": "Jorge",
    "campsite_id": 1,
    "created_at": "2015-12-15T21:22:55.620Z",
    "updated_at": "2015-12-15T21:22:55.620Z"
  },
  {
    "id": 3,
    "name": "Brian",
    "campsite_id": 1,
    "created_at": "2015-12-15T21:22:55.623Z",
    "updated_at": "2015-12-15T21:22:55.623Z"
  },
  {
    "id": 4,
    "name": "Jesse",
    "campsite_id": 2,
    "created_at": "2015-12-15T21:22:55.625Z",
    "updated_at": "2015-12-15T21:22:55.625Z"
  },
  {
    "id": 5,
    "name": "Maribeth",
    "campsite_id": 2,
    "created_at": "2015-12-15T21:22:55.627Z",
    "updated_at": "2015-12-15T21:22:55.627Z"
  },
  {
    "id": 6,
    "name": "Kelly",
    "campsite_id": 2,
    "created_at": "2015-12-15T21:22:55.628Z",
    "updated_at": "2015-12-15T21:22:55.628Z"
  },
  {
    "id": 7,
    "name": "David",
    "campsite_id": 3,
    "created_at": "2015-12-15T21:22:55.630Z",
    "updated_at": "2015-12-15T21:22:55.630Z"
  },
  {
    "id": 8,
    "name": "Phillip",
    "campsite_id": 3,
    "created_at": "2015-12-15T21:22:55.632Z",
    "updated_at": "2015-12-15T21:22:55.632Z"
  },
  {
    "id": 9,
    "name": "Kevin",
    "campsite_id": 3,
    "created_at": "2015-12-15T21:22:55.633Z",
    "updated_at": "2015-12-15T21:22:55.633Z"
  }
]
```

We've successfully created our API endpoint. From here, we can use fetch to seamlessly provide data to our React front end or other developers who might be looking to use our information! Creating this endpoint is key, since it is the source of our client-side API.

### Serialization with JSON and ActiveModel Serializer

When we look at the JSON output above, we can see two potential areas for improvement:

- In a larger database, the JSON output will not make sense when taken out of context since there is no reference in the JSON that it is a list of Campers. We should have a top level key that looks something like `campers` to address this.
- We have a lot of information in the JSON response that may not be relevant when working with our application. It would be great to only return what we need.

This is where Serialization comes into play. A **Serializer** allows us to format our outgoing response data into whatever may be needed. You can think of them as a kind of filter which only serves up certain information. For instance, we might not always need the timestamps that come with our `Camper` objects. Serializers give us the ability to only grab the info we want to immediately use, while keeping timestamps on the back burner.

The first step is to add the `active_model_serializers` gem to the Gemfile:

```ruby
# Gemfile
gem "active_model_serializers"
```

ActiveModel Serializer will also need to be configured with the correct adapter to return your JSON correctly. In `config/initializer/wrap_parameters.rb`, add this line to the top of your file:

```ruby
ActiveModelSerializers.config.adapter = :json
```

**Restart your server before moving forward.**

We will also want to configure your serializer and set the _root_ to your JSON file. ActiveModel Serializer can do this for you automatically. It provides lots of nice functionality like this to make creating an API endpoint much simpler and DRYer!

Now, let's clean up our output to display only the information we want, such as the camper ID, camper name, and campsite ID to which each camper belongs. Let's first create our `CamperSerializer` model. This will be the serializer for the `Camper` model. Rails will use its conventions to determine which serializer to use if you do not specify one. Whenever we `render json:` from the `Camper` model, Rails will know to use this serializer by default! Pretty cool.

```no-highlight
$ bundle exec rails g serializer camper
create  app/serializers/camper_serializer.rb
```

Now, we have a serializer in our app folder for our campsite app. The `g serializer` command will create the `serializers` folder for us and it will make a basic template for our serializer, just like you're used to for the `g migration` command. This will give us a starting point for our `CamperSerializer`. The default format looks like this:

```ruby
# app/serializers/camper_serializer.rb
class CamperSerializer < ActiveModel::Serializer
  attributes :id
end
```

It's important to note that the `CamperSerializer` is inheriting from the class `ActiveModel::Serializer` which is defined in the active_model_serializers gem that we installed. This is what is giving us all of our wonderful serialization behavior. The `attributes` method within this class will determine what attributes are returned as JSON for the model when this serializer is used. You will notice that to start off, this is just the `id`. Visiting <http://localhost:3000/api/v1/campers> will now result in the following:

```json
{
  "campers": [
    { "id": 1 },
    { "id": 2 },
    { "id": 3 },
    { "id": 4 },
    { "id": 5 },
    { "id": 6 },
    { "id": 7 },
    { "id": 8 },
    { "id": 9 }
  ]
}
```

If we want to render back each camper's name and campsite_id in our JSON, we can add these attributes to our `camper_serializer.rb` file like the following:

```ruby
# app/serializers/camper_serializer.rb
class CamperSerializer < ActiveModel::Serializer
  attributes :id, :name, :campsite_id
end
```

New Output:

```json
{
  "campers": [
    { "id": 1, "name": "Rovaira", "campsite_id": 1 },
    { "id": 2, "name": "Jorge", "campsite_id": 1 },
    { "id": 3, "name": "Brian", "campsite_id": 1 },
    { "id": 4, "name": "Jesse", "campsite_id": 2 },
    { "id": 5, "name": "Maribeth", "campsite_id": 2 },
    { "id": 6, "name": "Kelly", "campsite_id": 2 },
    { "id": 7, "name": "David", "campsite_id": 3 },
    { "id": 8, "name": "Phillip", "campsite_id": 3 },
    { "id": 9, "name": "Kevin", "campsite_id": 3 }
  ]
}
```

Now when we visit <http://localhost:3000/api/v1/campers>, the output will include each camper's name and campsite_id! It will also not include the attributes that we did not specify in the `CamperSerializer` such as `created_at` and `updated_at`. For more ways to modify your serializers and more advanced features, look at the Github Repo for the active_model_serializers [here](https://github.com/rails-api/active_model_serializers).

### Conclusion

Now that our application has a way of sending JSON responses by using an API, we can use these JavaScript objects in our application, especially in React with Fetch. This will allow us to have robust databases and models handled on the Rails side and a React front end that displays all of that wonderful data.
