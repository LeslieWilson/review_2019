JavaScript can be used to compartmentalize data into Objects using Class Definitions. We can add behavior to JavaScript classes to read information through "getters" and modify information through "setters"

## Getting Started

To get the source code and execute the program run the following commands:

```no-highlight
et get javascript-class-behavior
cd javascript-class-behavior
node debug getters.js
```

## Learning Objectives

* Justify the need for classes in Object Oriented Programming
* Declare a JavaScript class
* Build and invoke a JavaScript constructor
* Implement reader methods for a class
