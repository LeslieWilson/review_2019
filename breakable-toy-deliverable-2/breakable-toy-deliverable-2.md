By this point, you should have met with your mentor to solidify your Breakable Toy idea. Amongst other things, you should have established what your starting point will be in tackling the app - what your first model will be, and what the first couple features involving that model will be. If you feel unsure about this, reach out to your mentor, since you'll need that plan for this next step!

### Setup
```no-highlight
et get breakable-toy-deliverable-2
```

## What to submit

### ER Diagrams

Please submit two ER diagrams:

- One diagram that represents the future state of your database after you finish your very first couple features. This should only be *one or two models*.
- One diagram that represents a more complete view of where you would like your models/database to go. This can include most/all of the models you plan on (reasonably) including your app in the next two weeks. (It is okay if this changes as you go, we just want to get a sense of where you are going in the longer term.)

*This is both a more complete version and where I want it to go. This is not a database heavy app*

Make sure to clearly name these ER diagrams so we can easily tell them apart.

### Brief Description (aka Your "Elevator Pitch")

*VERSION 1 OF BREAKABLE TOY PITCH FOR COMPANIES*

-I no longer have it, but after I gave my first pitch, I took out things  that talked about how awesome launch academy has been and I inserted more information in about my breakable toy. I also took out some personal information  as per the suggestions of nick.

*VERSION 2 OF BREAKABLE TOY PITCH FOR  COMPANIES*

my name is leslie, I have a very strong sense of identity. I’m a queer woman I’m latina.

I come from a bit of a rough background, but that’s pretty far in the past, in the end I made it to college and majored in history.

but I knew I needed more education, so, I snuck into meeting with doctors at dartmouth, until someone hired and helped me to get into dartmouth medical school for gradschool.

That’s where I got an interest in computation, I was surrounded by it,
so decided to do another bachelors computer science.

I became a full time computer science teacher at a highschool at that time, teaching jrs and sr’s html, css and ruby.  they were so cute.

But I knew I wanted  to work for an awesome  tech company! so I came to launch

My app is a website for a free bootcamp I’d like to start one day to help low income and people of color enjoy the same things I’ve been lucky enough to have access to.

the app is called worker education. it puts people into a pipeline to a bachelors of science degree which makes the experience even more valuable for them in this ever changing job market.

This was my initial design in xd, I used the prototyping feature to make realistic website before I even started.

you select one of two options, to sign up with a bachelors degree or without, and offers a timeline for education in either case. There’s a weekly calander that lets you schedule a call and shoots admins an email.

hopefully this app will help make a more equitable future, and I’m really excited to for for a tech company and have this opportunity.  

NOTES FOR IMPROVEMENT:

LESS PERSONAL INFORMATION, MORE LINES ABOUT THE TECH OF THE APP (NEED TO FIGURE OUT SOMETHING ELSE FANCY TO PUT IN IT)

## How to submit

For your ER diagrams, please submit image files (i.e., if you made a diagram on Draw.io, take a screenshot!). You can submit your user stories, acceptance criteria and description in any text format you'd like. Markdown, .txt, .doc files, or even links to Google Docs are all fine!

These files should be placed in the `breakable-toy-deliverable-2` directory. If you are using Google Docs, please create a .txt file and paste the links there.
